## Project Overview
This project involves the implementation of three machine learning algorithms from scratch: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naïve Bayes, and Decision Trees. These implementations were generated using ChatGPT and further analyzed for their performance on different datasets. The goal is to evaluate both the effectiveness of the algorithms and the quality of the prompts used in ChatGPT, as well as to provide critical analysis for the generated code.

## Files Included
- `KNN.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm implementation, testing, and critical analysis.
- `Naïve Bayes.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Naïve Bayes algorithm implementation, testing, and critical analysis.
- `Decision Tree.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Decision Trees algorithm implementation, testing, and critical analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing a summary of the project, instructions for replication, and team member details.

## Prerequisites
To replicate the results, you need the following:
- **Python Version**: 3.8 or higher
- **Required Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`
  - `pandas`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Instructions for Running the Notebooks
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open each `.ipynb` file (e.g., `KNN.ipynb`, `Naïve Bayes.ipynb`, `Decision Tree.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells in each notebook sequentially to execute the code, visualize the results, and read the critical analysis.
4. Make sure the necessary datasets are loaded into the environment, or modify the notebook paths to point to your local datasets.

## Datasets Used
The following datasets were used to test the algorithms:
- **Iris Dataset**
- **Penguins Dataset**
- **Titanic Dataset**
- **Census Income Dataset**

These datasets are loaded directly from `scikit-learn` or can be downloaded from other public repositories.

## Critical Analysis
Each Jupyter Notebook includes a section on critical analysis, where we:
- Discuss the strengths and limitations of the algorithm implementations.
- Highlight any differences between ChatGPT-generated code and standard implementations.
- Offer suggestions for improvements in terms of performance, readability, and adherence to best practices.

## Assignment Objectives
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: 3 points total, focusing on implementation, dataset testing, and critical analysis.
- **Naïve Bayes**: 3.5 points total, focusing on implementation, dataset testing, and critical analysis.
- **Decision Trees**: 3.5 points total, focusing on implementation, dataset testing, and critical analysis.
